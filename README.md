# PERN Stack Project

This repository contains a full-stack application built with the PERN stack, which includes PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The project is designed to illustrate the seamless integration of these technologies to form a robust web application.

## Description

The PERN stack project demonstrates a simple yet comprehensive implementation of a web application using one of the most efficient stacks in modern web development. It is suitable for developers looking to understand the connectivity between a React frontend, Node.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database, all tied together with Express.js as the server framework.

## Technologies

- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database system.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
